# API Documentation

####  Backend deployed at [Heroku](production: https://production-lambda-synaps-be.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run start** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

### Backend framework goes here

Node:  Express, Postgres

- Node.js - We chose this to improve the efficiency and overall developer productivity. This is also excellent use for code sharing and reusability. Even greater benefits are the speed and the performance thanks to Node. With this we use the Express.js to allow us to build the app in the most efficient way.
